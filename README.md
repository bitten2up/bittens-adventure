# bittens-adventure
the game bitten's adventure that I am currently working on

# building
for the stable branch you will need msys2 and sfml on windows and on Linux you will need libsfml-dev
for the next branch you will need msys2, sdl2, and sdl2_image on windows and on Linux you will need libsdl2-dev and libsdl2-image-dev, the dependices are different because I am switching to sdl2


```bash
make
```
# Running
```bash
make run
``` 
to run it on windows or
```bash
make run-unix
```
to run it on linux/Mac os.
